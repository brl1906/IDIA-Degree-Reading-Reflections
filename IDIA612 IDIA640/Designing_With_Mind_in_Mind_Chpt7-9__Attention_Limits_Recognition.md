(p.87) Reflections on short vs long term memory included a useful analogy to computer memory associating a cpu working memory with short term memorty and long term memory wiht RAM.  Later chapters and Collin Ware, Visual Thinking, espcially chapters 6 and 7 reinforce the idea that memory is much more about pattern recognition and, to extend the computer analogy, is a function of parallel processing across multiple systems to establish, recognize and reinforce or self reinforce patterns.


The idea that (p.88) 'the initial strength of perception depends on how much it is amplified or dampend by other brain activity' (long term memory) and that is is a factor of changes at the nueron level also reinforces the idea expressed by Ware on (p118) that long term priming  or "perceptual facilitation" as implicit memory is a measure of how strong or faint an impression is when a pattern is established.  Making things easier for futur recall. 

Change Blindness and Inattention Blindness are useful frameworks for understanding problems in recall and task performance that should be front of mind in designing interactions. Gorilla study. 

The idea expressed in (p.113) about the poorly designed ATM screen is a perfect example of what is described by Robert Martin in his book Clean Code and his argument that great programmers are extremely discerning about selecting, reselecting and agonizing over variable names.
