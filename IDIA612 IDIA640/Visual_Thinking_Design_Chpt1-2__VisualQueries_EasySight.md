Similar to Johnson in Designing with Mind in Mind, makes the point that the notion that we make decisions based on an abundance of data through sight is false but rather a very limited amount of what we see is perceptible. Not all information but the "right amount of information" to carry us through a task.  Common theme.   Designer's task is assessting what information is right and how much to focus and maximize completion of an certain anticipated task by th user. 

**Phenonmenon explained:**  (p3) "At a cognitive level we allocate scarce 'working memory' resources to briefly retiain in focal attention only those pieces of information most likely to be useful."

Design should be ifnormed by the understanding of visual pattern recognition and perceptio and memory. (p3)

The idea that there are inner and outer loops of visual search process supports the idea of distributed processing.  Outer loop for move and scan, Eye Movement control loop planning and executing movements and the Pattern-testing loop which is the inner loop.

Key Terminology:
* Visual Query
* Top Down image processings -- task driven (priming, linking and re linking)
* Distributed Cognition - idea that information processing results from interconnected processing models. Like parent, chlid functions and classes inheriting and initializing one another. 


A helpful way to frame a project-based question around design is 'What are the most common  visual queries my unique user(s) are most likely to make? How do I not only not frustrate their execution of these queries but aide them.'
