Nueroesthetics and end of 20th century term.

The article and definition were helpful in providing an academic framework or descriptive langauge for the relationship we have been reading in Collin Ware adn some of Johnson's work. -- The idea that Nueroesthetics is separate from the biological study of our ability to produce and appreciate art, but rather as the study of the physiological identifiable, quantifiable, namable events associated with esthetic choice, experience and creation. 

These observations help lay a ground work for anticipation and prediction in behavior related to not only as what transpires after recognition but what, will get recognized -- the irony is not lost that there is an identified 'what' section of the brain at play in pattern/ object recognition. 


I am not sure why, but I am not surprised by the findings that artists highly artistic expressive people are not immune to the way cognitive impairment later in life impacts the ability to appreciate or create art. Also not surprising is that esthetic preferences is "resilient in the face of neurological conditions" as this has to do not only with the physiological process in the brain but also, taste, culture, preference, memory and expeirnce.   This idea is expressed later better here (p.5)  when Nadal writes:
**"Several studies haveshown that personal attitude toward the object presented and beliefs about it have strong effects. Cupchik et al. (2009)
demonstrated that peopleâ€™s orientation toward paintings
modulated brain activity associated with esthetic preference."**

Trying to identify and define the biologlical mechanisms of emotial aspects of esthetic response if fascinating!!  Is happiness a pattern? Can the pattern change?
