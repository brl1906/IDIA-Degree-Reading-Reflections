[How To Get People To Do Stuff; Master the Art & Science of Persuasion and Motivation ](https://emotionalmanipulation.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/how-to-get-people-to-do-stuff.pdf)


Indicates that there are 7 drives that motiviate people to act and if understood, can help anticipate, understand and potentially guide human behavior.They include: 
* Belonging
* Habits
* Power of Stories
* Carrots & Sticks
* Instincts
* Desire for Mastery
* Tricks of Mind



Regarding stories, it is important to understand how people talk about themselfves, the stories and narratives they create about themselves provides important information for getting people to act. 

Author arguest that the desire for internal mastery is a stronger motivating force than that of reward.  I wonder if this is true in all cases though or is an assumption made here about the personality profile. 


Key Point:
1. People who fell connected work harder.  (The task then is to make them feel connected).

--using nouns instead of verbs as a strategy to incuce feeling of belonging & identigy.

Familiarity and attractiveness trigger persuasion and people's willingness to do a thing when asked. Having the right person makes a difference--someone who is known to the audience and or is perceived to be attractive.  Indebtedness adn ceciprocity are also similarly strong motiviators that appeal to a sense of duty and owing a person. (Example, giving gum to a stranger on a plane or foregoing a seat or place in line). Produce a feeling of debt and the need to reciprocate.

2. "Rejection & Retreat"  Rejection & Retreat is a method of persuasion. Asking for a thing(s) above the normal or required request to force a 'No', which acts like a gift that invokes some feeling of reciprocity leading ot a concession or retreat to a reduced position.  Most impactful when the retreat is perceived to be 'fair'.

3. Trust works on the recipriciprocity or indebtedness principle. One of the easiest ways to get someone to trust you--not with out risk--is to show them that you trust them. Examples of facilitating this can include offering or asking someone to perform a high level or trusted task you normally would or entrusting them with something larger than normal and expressing the commitment to trust.  This trust makes people more likely to do things you want them to do. Author gives the analogy that like a hug, the chemical oxytocin is released in the person receiving the hug as do levels of oxytocin increase when they are bestowed trust.  Think of trust issuances as hugs -- 'trust hug'.
