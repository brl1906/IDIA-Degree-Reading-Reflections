[How To Get People To Do Stuff; Master the Art & Science of Persuasion and Motivation ](https://emotionalmanipulation.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/how-to-get-people-to-do-stuff.pdf)

References the Charles Duhigg book ,'Power of Habit' and his explanation of the cycle of a habit of Cues, Routines and Rewards.  Understanding the elements of the cycle individually is key to creating new or rerouting or rewirign existing habits.

Key Points:
1. If you want someone to create a new habit, take some time to figure out what will be their new 'cue' and 'reward'.

2. There are 3 elements or 'secrets' essential to encouraging yourself or others to initiate a new habit. They include: 
    * **A**. making sure there is incrimental progress
    * **B**. removing additional decisions -- the only main or hard decision should be to initiate and all other thinking should be either handled, pre-decided, or so minimal that it can be handled subconsciously.  Don't require additional mental load of decision making around the habit.
    * **C**. show the progress--allow for visualization of the then to now. 


3. Anchoring new habits to existing habits is a very strong method or 'hack' for establishing new habits. Example was to drink 1/2 glass of water a day -- use the existing mornign habit of taking medication upon waking to insert a new practice of keeping a glass by the bed, immediately filling it in bathroom, drinking and then filling it back up 1/2 and placing it at the bedside for the next day when the routine starts again of waking and taking medicine.  In this way, the new habit leverages an existing strong and established habit.
