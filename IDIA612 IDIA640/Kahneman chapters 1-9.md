The description of the two types of thinking systems system 1 and sytem 2 or low and high level or immediate pattern recogniction versus calculation. Kahneman's point that other mental activities can become fast and automatic through prolonged practice  speaks to the flexibility of System 1, that its boundaries are not fixed. And that it included social associations and learned skills. 

I understand this as contextual priming or reving the engine for a certain type of pattern recognition to move activities that would otherwise required system 2 thinking to be shifted to system 1, reducing mental load for those tasks. The chess example is appropriate.   

An interesting thought though, is how far this spectrum spands or if actvites existsomewhere on a plane that has system 1 and system 2 thinking on the same axis. If so, where would certain items fall --ie, what are the natural boundaries of those items 

The profoundly interesting piece here for me, is the interaction between the 2 systems  
Key takeaway:
 (chapt 1.)"Anything that occupies your workign memory reduces your ability to think. "

"Cognitive Pupilometry" and the study of level of cognitive effort , its ebsbs and flows and cesation being observed throuth the dilation of pupils, as in the Add 1 stdy with digits if fascinating.  A useful metaphor.

The introduction of 'flow' is an interesting concept here. He describes it as when "neatly separates the two forms of effort: concentration on the task and the deliberate control of attention." Mihaly, the author of Flow even uses the game of tennis for a highly skiilled player as possibly provoking a state of flow. However, it isnt clear that the earned skill and pattern recognition that enable flow, do in turn open up processing capacity to think on higher level tasks simultaneously.  I understood "flow" to be more useful as an explanation framework for enjoyment and endurance. 

Sarcasticaly, his explanation of the inverse relationship between use of cognitive energy for complex tasks and will power, discernment and self regulation sort of explain Wall Street.  He offers, "People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social
situations." (p.41) -- The Busy & Depleted System


I have heard the below study referrenced many times in conversation, folklore adn presentations or talks but never knew the source. Citing the below for future use. As an aside, this is an interesting statistcal study--the process for determinign a significant explanation. 
**Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The
unwitting participants in the study were eight parole judges in Israel. They
spend entire days reviewing applications for parole. The cases are
presented in random order, and the judges spend little time on each one,
an average of 6 minutes. (The default decision is denial of parole; only
35% of requests are approved. The exact time of each decision is
recorded, and the times of the judges’ three food breaks—morning break,
lunch, and afternoon break—during the day are recorded as well.)Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The

(p.54) This is the best definition of what an idea is I have ever read or encoungered. Marking this here for future reference or use: 
It invokes the idea of unknown--to you--patterns of nodes and strong or weak edges


**I will adopt an expansive view of what an idea is. It can be concrete or
abstract, and it can be expressed in many ways: as a verb, as a noun, as
an adjective, or as a clenched fist. Psychologists think of ideas as nodes in
a vast network, called associative memory, in which each idea is linked to many others. There are different types of links: causes are linked to their
effects (virus cold); things to their properties (lime green); things to
the categories to which they belong (banana fruit). One way we have
advanced beyond Hume is that we no longer think of the mind as going
through a sequence of conscious ideas, one at a time. In the current view
of how associative memory works, a great deal happens at once. An idea
that has been activated does not merely evoke one other idea. It activates
many ideas, which in turn activate others. Furthermore, only a few of the
activated ideas will register in consciousness; most of the work of
associative thinking is silent, hidden from our conscious selves.**
