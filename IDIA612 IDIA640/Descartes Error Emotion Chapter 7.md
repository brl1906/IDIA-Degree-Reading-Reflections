Early core critique, I agree with that emotion plays a role in cognitive behavior and understanding cognitive events and communication -- particularly non verbal. 
Quote offers a helpful way to understand his critique as well as thought abuot emotion: **"Matters were not made more clear by his lapidary
statement: "Every object that excites an instinct excites an emotion
as well." In many circumstances of our life as social beings, however, we
know that our emotions are triggered only after an evaluative, voluntary, nonautomatic mental process."**

(p.31) Expands upont this stacking the early vs late development mechanisms that enable emotion: **" I
begin with the perspective of personal history, and clarify the differences between the emotions we experience early in life, for which a
Jamesian "preorganized mechanism" would suffice, . and the emotions we experience as adults, whose scaffolding has been built
gradually on the foundation of those "early" emotions. I propose
calling "early" emotions primary, and "adult" emotions secondary."**

The idea of secondary emotions (p.134) suggests a non reflexive, processing event that triggers thinking about the meanign and context of a trigger prior to and producing an emotional response--it contrasts with for example a small chick in a next reflexively ducking or shrinking at its first sight of an eagle overhead with wings spread.
