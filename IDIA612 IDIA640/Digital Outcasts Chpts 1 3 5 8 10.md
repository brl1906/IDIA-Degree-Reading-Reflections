Suprising to hear about the relationship between learning disabilities, the needs of people and their families and technological innovation.  The discussion on accessibility being a "niche" market isn't consistent with the opening idea that the community of learning disabled is spawning tremendous innovation in tech nor consistent with the fact that many of the 'most ensuring products had their beginings as prototypes designed fro a relatively small audience segment (p.20)'. However, that mindset and language around "lowest common denominator" helps make clear the friction between the design side and business side. 

The example about the use of curb cut ramps for accessing a sidewalk from a street is a perfect illustration of this principle that desining for people with access challenges improves and eases experiencs for other users.  As I reflect on this, as a runner, I can't remember the last time on a jog that I didn't use the curb-cut ramp.

Thinking about these as "Ramp vs. Stairs Moments" is helpful.  

**"Today's disabled users are not outliers of the able-bodied population--they are a prototype of what our future looks like."** (p.8)  Powerful. Aging 2.0

It is hard to imagine the daily life of the 1 in 5 American adults (according to the cited 2012 survey) does not use the internet and that avoidance is not limited to seniors.   What does that persons' day look like? How do they engage in the basic functions I do, or I take for granted? What is the cost of that in time?

I love the definition of universal design. They just get used! (p.54) The distinction between universal design and handicap accesible is critical.  That the accessible facility may be clunky or appear to be forced in design to accomodate an overarching goal or may segregate based on ability or appearance versus, universal design which is about "difusing the boundaries between these delineations so that features are neither notably accessible or inaccessible."  I love this definition. 

Pillars vs. Benchmarks is a good way of thinking about how not to undermine the design process.  Not a checklist of things to do, but a series of principles and pillars like: equivalent use, low physical effort and flexibilty in use, for example. 


Some useful core ideas, take aways:
* accessibilty vs usability
* pillars vs benchmarks
* 'Ramp vs. Stairs Moments'
* Accessiblity vs. Ease of Access -- Microsoft


The example of effective uses of alt text in an image tag and how this is presented to and helps the reader makes a difference in trying to understand the consumer of your web content. 

Invocing Soul Train and Don Cornellius was an unexpected turn in the readings, particularly in the section on moving beyond accessibility. It was a useful metaphor and one that will stick with me.  I will use the Soul Traini analogy in the future for certain to persuade on the benefits of universal design. (p.67)


I admit sheepishly that I never thought deeply about the experience of an iPhone user with a disability attempting to navigate the device the way I would.  While attempting to make a different point, I am struck by how great an example of the (POTENTIALLY) equalizing force of tech in the Steve Wonder example. The autor quotes (p. 236) Steve Wonder  from 2011 that "There's nothing on the iPhone that you can do that I can't do."

I am guilty of the assumption that persons with certain disablities are operating from a place of compromise rather than from a place strengthened by years of adaptation and reslience. 

The change in the video game industry in response to the recognition of aging customer base and those needs is a great example of how market realities can drive a greater focus on accessible design. (p.239)  This was a great example! Having stated then, that the averag age of a video game player has increased by 7 years since 1995, I wonder what it is now?
