Reflections on 10/2/2019 readings
## Never Undersestimate The Power of Inertia

The readings are extremely relevant to my work--much of which involves navigating uncertainty around policy outcomes and analysis to support a policy or management decision and communicating that to decision makers or making the decision myself. 

The chapters helped me think more critically about why it is dififcult for people, colleuages, supervisors to make big decisions.  The frameworks for helping illuminate the best choice were helpful tools -- particularly the "Understanding Mappings" device. 

For example, framing a decision point or question around the financial benefits of making a certain decision to suppport public spending seem to be easier when talking about future cost avoidance.  Prior to the reading I used different terms to describe the differences in thinking I saw but "understanding mapping" and thinking about "default" scenarios are interestign and apt terms. 

Other related reflections:
I am still resolving my inner battle with the term **libertarian paternalism**. The author's definition and rationale are clear enough, but I grapple with the word choice. 

A few very illustrative examples of nudging in design standout useful for future talks, presentations, writings: 
* the 25% change in consumption patterns of food triggered by placement
* the 80% decrease in "spillage" when a fly is painted on an airport urinal  (p.4)
