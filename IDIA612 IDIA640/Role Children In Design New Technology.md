Druin writes "In addition, as we know, young children have
a more difficult time verbalizing their thoughts, especially when it concerns abstract
concepts and actions (Piaget, 1971; Piaget, 1973). While children can be extremely
honest in their feedback and comments concerning technology, much of what they say
needs to be interpreted within the context of concrete experiences (Druin, 1999).
For all of these reasons, a childâ€™s role in the design of new technology has historically
been minimized. " However, I wonder if it isn't simply an issue of limited abstract communiction power on the part of children, and not a failure of us as adults to develop tools and technology that bridge the gap and allow for more expressive communication or some intermediary tool to translate those needs and observations and wants of kids at a level designers and practicioners can work with. 

Intersting note:
* discussion of children in HCI Human Computer Interaction sparked from conference paper in 1982 on the subject but didnt' really grow untill mid 90s.
* Druin suggests 4 roles for children: User, Tester, Informant, Design Partner
* Great example of the child as informant and possible outcome is in the design of a user interface for an encyclopedia application. the designers chose a Tree metaphor as the entry point abandoning windows and menus. It was based on interviews with students to ask about where they like to play after school. 

Key Terms:
* Consructionist -- notion in 80s that cpu shouldn't tell the child what to do but the child instruct the computer to create unique paths to learning and new expeirence. 
* Logo Research @ MIT -- created new programming language for children, early 70s
